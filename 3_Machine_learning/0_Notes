3 types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforced

 - Supervised learning: learns from labeled training data in order to male prediction about future events.
        - Supervised learning with discrete class labels is called classification task (spam filters)
        The goal here is to predict the categories of new instances based on prior data.
        Multi class classification task is handwriting recognition (you have a lot of characters).
        - Regression analysis (continuous outcomes).
        Given a predictor variable x and response variable y we can build regression line.

 - Reinforced learning: the goal is to develop the system that improves based on interactions with environment.
 The agent does an action, the environment responds with the reward signal that measures how well the action was
 measured by reward function. Then the agent thrugh series of action will learn what maximizes the reward.

- Unsupervised learning: we are dealign with the unknown data and the algorithm needs to extract meaningful information
without the guidance of known outcome variable or reward function.
        - Finding subgroups with clustering: clustering unknown data where objects share certain similarities
        - Dimensionality reduction: reducing the number of dimension while analyzing data

Machine learning model:
1. Pre-processing
    - Working with the raw data and extracting the useful set of features
    - Some of the featured may be redundant and highly correlated, thus dimensionality reduction is necessary
    - We also divide our data set into Training and Test sets (test set is used to test the algorithm)

2. Training and selecting predictive model
    - Each algorithm has it biases
    - You need to compare a handful of algorithms to train and select the best model
    - Select the metric of performance (one can be classification accuracy; proportion of correctly classified instances)

3. Evaluating models and predicting unseen data instances
    - Use test dataset to estimate how well the model performs

The modules we will be using:
 - NumPy
 - SciPy
 - scikit-learn
 - matplotlib
 - pandas
