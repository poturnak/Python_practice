# Regression analysis is used to predict the variables on a continuous scale
# The goal of a simple linear regaression model is to model the relationship
# between signle feature (explanatory variable x) and a continuous valued response y.
#  y = w0 + w1*x

# regression is different from pca in a way that pca minimizes the projection errors (perpendicular
# projection from endpoints onto the pca component)
# the regression is minimizing offsets - errors of prediction
